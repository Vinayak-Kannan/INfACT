The course familiarizes students with machine learning algorithms and applications while providing a solid foundation in statistics/mathematics and enhancing their business acumen. The course is divided into two parts: Part 1: Python for Data Analytics (Video content and delivery by Emeritus) and Part 2: Applied Machine Learning (Video content from Columbia Engineering and delivery by Emeritus). The course requires students to write code, but no prior programming knowledge is required. The course is appropriate for those looking to implement or lead a machine learning project or looking to incorporate machine learning capability in their software application. The course is designed to teach students models and methods used in machine learning for real-world applications such as recommender systems and classification models. Students work on application projects that require them to apply the machine learning concepts they’ve learned to datasets and derive inferences. These application projects are easy to assimilate and implement.

. The course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset. The course is designed for high school students and covers topics such as big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. The course is a hands-on experience and practice where students study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions. The course features real-world applications of data analytics across industries and challenges students to think.
