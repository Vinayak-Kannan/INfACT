. The course is designed for professionals who want to master the models of machine learning while acquiring the Python programming knowledge to real-world data. The course is a blend of theory, tools, and case studies (datasets) that are easy to assimilate and implement. The course familiarizes students with machine learning algorithms and applications while providing a solid foundation in statistics/mathematics and enhancing their business acumen. The course is divided into two parts: Part 1: Python for Data Analytics (Video content and delivery by Emeritus) and Part 2: Applied Machine Learning (Video content from Columbia Engineering and delivery by Emeritus). The course requires students to write code, but no prior programming knowledge is required. The course is appropriate for those looking to implement or lead a machine learning project or looking to incorporate machine learning capability in their software application. The course is designed to teach students models and methods used in machine learning for real-world applications such as recommender systems and classification models. Students work on application projects that require them to apply the machine learning concepts they’ve learned to datasets and derive inferences. These application projects are easy to assimilate and implement.

. The course enables participants to navigate the new reality of the “data economy,” in which data is the “the new oil”—a ubiquitous and invaluable asset. The course is designed for high school students and covers topics such as big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, cloud computing, and data ethics in the context of real-world business scenarios. The course is a hands-on experience and practice where students study data harvesting and exploration, as well as the basics of data visualization. After they get comfortable with data manipulation and transformation, they gain familiarity with statistical frameworks and methods designed to extract practical insights from data. Participants learn and implement common machine-learning techniques and develop and evaluate analytical solutions. The course features real-world applications of data analytics across industries and challenges students to think.

. Students can study part-time while maintaining their work schedule or study at an accelerated pace through the full-time format
1
.
The course is divided into two phases: Foundation and Application
1
. The Foundation phase equips students with the fundamental concepts of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
1
. The Application phase builds on the Foundation phase and covers more advanced topics such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB
1
.
Throughout the course, students will work on several projects to build their portfolio, including a personal portfolio, a group project, and a final project
1
. The final project is a culmination of the skills learned throughout the course and is designed to showcase the student's abilities to potential employers
1
.
By the end of the course, students will have gained in-demand full-stack development skills, including JavaScript, databases like MySQL and MongoDB, progressive web applications, browser-based technologies, deployment/command-line fundamentals, and API interactions
1
. They will also have learned agile methodology, computer science, and database theory
1
.
In summary, the Full Stack Web Development course at Columbia University covers a comprehensive curriculum that includes both front-end and back-end web development skills. Students will work on several projects throughout the course to build their portfolio and showcase their abilities to potential employers. By the end of the course, students will have gained in-demand skills and knowledge in full-stack web development, agile methodology, computer science, and database theory."

. The course is taught by Professor Michelle Levine and is designed to teach students how to critically examine previous research, build and test hypotheses, and collect data in the most ethical and robust manner
1
. The course is divided into three parts:
Data Collection: In this part of the seminar, students will explore different means of data collection and dive into ethical concerns in research
1
. Topics covered include conducting a literature review, scientific method and big data, designing a study, and data collection methods
1
.
Data Analysis: In this part of the seminar, students will learn how to most effectively analyze different data sets and how to present the data in engaging and exciting ways
1
. Topics covered include data analysis tools (NLP demo) and data analysis techniques
1
.
Research Methods: In the last part of the seminar, students will hear from different researchers on the methods they use to conduct research, lending to further conversations about when and how to use particular research methods
1
. The focus will be primarily on relatively small data sets, but big data will also be addressed
1
.
The course is designed as an introduction to the elements that constitute the skill set of a data scientist, with a focus on the utility of these elements in common tasks of a data scientist, rather than their theoretical formulation and properties
